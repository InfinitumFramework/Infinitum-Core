These are the steps to follow when setting up Infinitum module JUnit tests. These steps are for an
Eclipse environment, but you shouldn't have any issues setting it up in another IDE.

1. Create test harness project (normal Java project).
2. Delete the "src" directory from the project.
3. Add a source link to the Infinitum module "test" directory (Properties > Java Build Path > Source > Link Source...).
4. Add the Infinitum module as a project dependency to the test project (Properties > Java Build Path > Projects > Add...).
5. Add the JARs located in the Infinitum module's test-libs directory to the test project's build path.
6. Add the JUnit 4 library to the test project's build path (Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries > Add Library...).
7. Create a new run configuration for the test project.
	7.1. Select the option "Run all tests in the selected project, package or source folder" and select the test project.
	7.2. Check "Use configuration specific settings" and select the Eclipse JUnit Launcher.
	7.3. Select JUnit 4 as the test runner.
	7.4. In the "Arguments" tab, under "Working directory, select "Other", click "Workspace", and select the Infinitum module.
