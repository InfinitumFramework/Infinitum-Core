/**
 * <p>
 * Indicates that the annotated {@link View} is to be bound to a callback method
 * for a given event type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code event} attribute corresponds to the event type, while
 * {@code callback} indicates the name of the method to be invoked. If an
 * {@link Event} is not specified, {@code Event.OnClick} is used by default.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The callback method should match the normal listener method in terms of its
 * return type and arguments. For example, an {@code onClick} callback should be
 * {@code void} and take a {@code View} as its argument, while an {@code onKey}
 * callback must return a {@code boolean} and take a {@code View}, {@code int},
 * and {@link KeyEvent} as its arguments.
