/**
 * <p>
 * Specialization of the {@link Component} annotation indicating that the
 * annotated {@link Class} is a dependency-injection bean, meaning it is a
 * candidate for auto-detection by the framework if classpath scanning is
 * enabled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code Beans} that are picked up during auto-detection are registered with
 * the {@link InfinitumContext} and stored in its {@link BeanFactory}. If a bean
 * name is not suggested, the bean will be registered using the camelcase
 * version of its {@code Class} name. For example, an annotated {@code Class}
 * {@code FooBar} will use the bean name {@code fooBar} unless otherwise
 * specified.
